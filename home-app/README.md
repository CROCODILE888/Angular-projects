# Angular Homes App
I am still unsure on how to publish an angular page on github.
- Install Angular if you don't have it installed

  `npm install -g @angular/cli`

- Once the code has been downloaded

  `cd homes-app`

- Install the dependencies

  `npm install` 

- Run the application 

  `ng serve`
